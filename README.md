## Work Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) @ Aerospace System Design Laboratory, Georgia Institute of Technology (August 2022 - May 2024)**
- Developed an optimized ConOps algorithm to manage a delivery UAM fleet in urban and semi-urban environment.
- Deployed an advanced ML-based tool to enhance flight safety insight detection in civil aviation.
- Conceived an advanced decision-making enhancement tool based on enterprise-architecture modeling & simulation. 
- Built a ROS2-based autonomous precision-landing framework for a UASV to land onto a moving USV.

## Projects
### [RobotX](https://github.com/gt-marine-robotics-group/robotx_ros2_ws)
- ROS2-based Multi-Agent Control framework for precision landing of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) onto a USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle).
- Robotics framework for a video-based feedback controller from Computer-Vision to drone control using Ardupilot.

### [Kalman Filtering Library](https://github.com/hchardin3/KalmanFiltering)
- Complete Python library for signal filtering, based on Linear Algebra and Probability theory.
- Various filters available, including KF, EKF, UKF, Particle Filters...

### [C++-based 3D Renderer](https://github.com/hchardin3/3DRenderer)
- 3D renderer software to represent complex objects in a 3D environment.
- Thought as a fun project to self-learn C++ (syntax, Object-Oriented Programming, hpp and cpp files, make files...).
- Still working on it.
